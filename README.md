Medium Article: https://medium.com/@otim22gerison/twitter-sentiment-analysis-project-89a754807850

This is a continuous iteration of a Sentiment Analysis Project I intend to build and deploy using Streamlit.
This is a Python based Sentiment Analysis project using Tweets to get an impression on whether an individual 
or particular set of tweets have positive, negative or neutral sentiments.
It is made of 2 files the scrap and clean file which scrapes tweets using Tweepy and then cleans before saving it as a csv file.
The main python files holds the analysis code which segments a tweet on a score and attaches a postive, negative or neutral value.
It is then run using Streamlit and sentiment analysis can be perform a text or a csv file and in the case of a csv file it can be 
downloaded and the results can be visualized or furthur analysis be made on it.
